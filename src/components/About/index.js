                <p> 
                I am a junior full-stack developer. I completed my certification with the University of Miami's EDX Bootcamp. I'm ambitious and eager to expand my knowledge of the latest technologies and gain experience with a role in an established tech company, building diverse projects.
                </p>
                Growing up on my little island of Jamaica, I have always been a naturally curious and innovative problem solver. I see so many of those traits in my son, which is why I became a developer. My ultimate goal is to share the same passions as my child while providing the best life I can for him. 
                <p>
                I am also a business owner. I started an auto parts company called Turboutique Auto Parts. I have always loved being in the automotive field and would be thrilled to implement my developer skills within the same space.
